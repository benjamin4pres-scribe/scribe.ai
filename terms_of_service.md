# Terms of Service

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By inviting **Scribe.AI** ("the Bot") to your Discord server or using its features (including but not limited to voice recording, AI summarization, and image generation), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the Bot.

## 2. Service Description

The Bot is a utility designed for Dungeons & Dragons and other Tabletop RPG sessions. Its primary functions include:

* Recording audio from Discord voice channels.

* Transcribing and summarizing audio using Artificial Intelligence.

* Generating fantasy-themed images based on user text prompts.

## 3. Privacy and Data Handling

Your privacy is critical. Here is how we handle your data:

### 3.1. Audio Recording

* **Consent:** By joining a voice channel where the Bot is active (indicated by the nickname "🔴 AI Recorder"), you consent to being recorded. It is the responsibility of the server administrator or the user invoking the `!join` / `/join` command to inform all participants that the session is being recorded.

* **Storage:** Audio files are stored temporarily on the host server to facilitate processing.

* **Deletion:** Temporary audio files are deleted automatically after the session summary is generated or when the `!clean` / `/clean` command is run. We do not maintain a permanent archive of your raw voice data.

### 3.2. AI Processing (Third-Party Services)

* The Bot uses **Google Gemini** (Generative AI) to process audio, text, and generate images.

* By using the Bot, you acknowledge that your data (audio snippets, text notes, and prompts) is sent to Google's servers for processing.

* Please review [Google's Generative AI Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) for more details on how they handle data.

## 4. User Conduct

You agree not to use the Bot to:

* Record individuals without their knowledge or consent (wiretapping).

* Generate images or text that are illegal, sexually explicit, hateful, or harass others.

* Violate Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) or [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines).

## 5. Limitations of Liability

The Bot is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranties of any kind. We are not liable for:

* Loss of data (e.g., failed recordings or lost summaries).

* Inaccuracies in AI-generated summaries or answers.

* Service downtime or interruptions.

## 6. Termination

We reserve the right to ban specific users or servers from using the Bot at any time, for any reason, without notice, particularly in cases of abuse or violation of these terms.

## 7. Contact

If you have questions about these Terms, please contact the developer via Discord: **thepawnking**.
