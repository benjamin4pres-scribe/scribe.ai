# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 29, 2025

## 1. Introduction

**Scribe.AI** ("the Bot") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding that data. We are committed to ensuring that your gaming sessions remain private and secure.

## 2. Information We Collect

To function correctly, the Bot collects and processes the following data:

### 2.1. Automatically Collected Information
* **Discord User & Guild IDs:** We use these unique identifiers to manage permissions, track session states, and ensure commands are executed in the correct server.
* **Voice Data:** When you join a voice channel where the Bot is active (recording), your audio is captured for the sole purpose of transcription and summarization.
* **Text Commands & Inputs:** We process the text you send via commands (e.g., `!note`, `!ask`, `!image`) to generate the requested output.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use your data strictly to provide the Bot's services:
* **Session Summarization:** Audio files are processed to create text summaries of your D&D sessions.
* **Content Generation:** Text prompts and notes are used to generate AI answers or images.
* **Technical Operation:** IDs are used to route messages and maintain connection stability.

## 4. Third-Party Data Sharing

We do not sell your data. However, to provide AI features, we must share specific data with our third-party AI provider:

* **Google Gemini (Google LLC):**
    * Audio recordings and text prompts are sent to Google's Generative AI API for processing.
    * This data is used solely to generate the response (summary, answer, or image) and is subject to [Google's AI Terms of Service](https://policies.google.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## 5. Data Retention and Security

* **Temporary Audio Storage:** Audio files (`.pcm` and `.wav`) are stored temporarily on the host server during the recording session.
* **Automatic Deletion:** Once a session summary is generated, the uploaded audio files are automatically deleted from the AI provider. Local temporary files on the host server can be deleted manually by the user via the `!clean` / `/clean` command or are overwritten in subsequent sessions.
* **No Permanent Audio Archive:** We do not maintain a long-term database of your voice recordings.

## 6. Your Rights

* **Consent:** You may withdraw consent for recording at any time by leaving the voice channel or using the `!leave` / `/leave` command to stop the bot.
* **Data Deletion:** You can trigger the immediate deletion of temporary local files using the `!clean` / `/clean` command.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last Updated" date at the top of this page will indicate the latest revision. Continued use of the Bot implies acceptance of the updated policy.
